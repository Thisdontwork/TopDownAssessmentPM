Hello my name will not be said at this time. The message you are reading is from the past and the future, but I am stuck here in the present. Go to the train tracks and stay on the tracks for 50 hours.PLz
Thats the only way to save me. If a train is coming stay don't worry about it, I will stop it from hitting you. You must promise me this because each second I am here the future will be affected as well. 
Do you want your childeren to fight in a war that is not suppose to happen. Now after you stayed on the tracks for the amount of time go to top of mount dfkhvwurk, and there I will give you powers to help
me go to the future and fight in the battle between the people who keep time safe and the people who wants to change everything. HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
